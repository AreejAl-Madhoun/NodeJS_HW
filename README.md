### NodeJS_HW
The Homework of node.js lab, working on the get and post API requests.

Create a simple that includes the  following APIs:
1. POST: /user: This api should return the data sent to it in JSON format in addition to your name, and it should return it in JSON format  too, for example If I sent {“name”:”AreejM.R.AlMadhon”} I should get the{“message”:”Welcome”, “name”:”AreejM.R.AlMadhon”}
2. GET: /user?<name>: This api should return a greeting message with the name sent in the URL, for example if I sent a GET request to /user?name=Areej13-4-1998 I should get {“message”:”Welcome Areej13-4-1998”} 
**Note**: create the backend with Node JS with express and test your api by using fetch method in client side .
