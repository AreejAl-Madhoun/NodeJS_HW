# NodeJS_HW
The Homework of node.js lab, working on the get and post requests.

Create a simple that includes the  following APIs:
1. POST: /user: This api should return the data sent to it in JSON format in addition to your name, and it should return it in JSON format  too, for example If I sent {“name”:”taymaa”} I should get the{“message”:”hello”, “name”:”taymaa”}
2. GET: /user?<name>: This api should return a greeting message with the name sent in the URL, for example if I sent a GET request to /user?name=Ali I should get {“message”:”Hello taymaa”} 
**Note**: create the backend with Node JS with express and test your api by using fetch method 
in client side .
